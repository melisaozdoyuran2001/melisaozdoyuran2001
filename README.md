## Hi there 👩‍💻🌼

### I’m Melisa,

💻 a dedicated software engineer who thrives on marrying creativity with innovation. My passion lies in designing user-centric solutions that are not only efficient but also enjoyable. If a challenge isn't inherently fun, I have a knack for turning it into a delightful experience.

🎓  on the cusp of graduating from Northwestern University, where I've pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, complemented by a minor in Economics.

🧐  particularly interested in the blend of UI/UX design principles with the technical aspects of software, web, and app development when creating successful, user-centered products.
